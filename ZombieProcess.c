/*  Write a C program to demonstrate Zombie Process.
    
    A process which has finished the execution but still has entry in the process table to report to its parent process is known as a zombie process.
    
    In this, the parent process is put to sleep for a long time while the child process is terminated using exit(0). 
    When a child process is terminated using exit(0) then the parent process still reads the status of the child process.
